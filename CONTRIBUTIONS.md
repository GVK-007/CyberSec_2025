Fork the Repository: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page to create your own copy of the project.

Create a New Branch: Before making any changes, create a new branch in your forked repository. This keeps your work organized. Use the following naming convention for your branch:

levelX/<your-github-handle>/<task-summary>

Example: level1/srimanth/network-setup

Add Your Files: Complete your task and add your deliverable files to the correct directory as specified in the level's instructions. Do not edit files outside of your designated submission folder.

Commit Your Changes: Save your work with a clear and descriptive commit message.

Open a Pull Request: Go to the original repository and open a new Pull Request from your branch.

# Ethical Rules & Code of Conduct
This is the most important section. Failure to follow these rules will result in your Pull Request being rejected.

Lab-Only Activity: All tasks MUST be performed in a simulated, isolated lab environment (like Cisco Packet Tracer or a personal VM setup). Never scan, test, or attack any system you do not own or have explicit, written permission to test.

No Sensitive Information: Redact or remove all personal and sensitive information from your submissions. This includes real IP addresses, MAC addresses, hostnames, and credentials.

No Exploit Code: Do not commit any functional exploit code to this repository. Analysis, reports, and detection rules are welcome; working exploits are not.

Be Respectful: Treat all participants and maintainers with respect. We are all here to learn.
